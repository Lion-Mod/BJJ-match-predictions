## Why this was done (more detail in the notebook)

I wanted to work on a problem that could grow my data skills and on something that (to my knowledge) has little or no one focusing on it. 

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu ðŸ¥‹ is a grappling sport that is still developing on the mat but not in the data world so I developed a baseline model for predicting matches. 

## Who this benefits
* **Match makers** - pair competitors with similar performances or certain styles
* **Coaches** - use data to analyse who their athlete's next competitor is and their style both currently and historically to improve training approaches for competition
* **Analysts/commentators** - stats about a fighter can be useful but when you have to watch hours of footage to get them, not efficient. The simple features added to the data can help find stats about a fighter to date or historically. Also some stats that aren't necessarily obvious or easy to compute using a brain could be encorporated into live commentatary. 

## Why I haven't included the data collection code
I wasn't happy with the way I collected and manipulated the data especially towards the end of the project and I was keen to get modelling ASAP so the code can be fairly messy. 

As mentioned in the notebook the majority of features were cumulatively summed and lagged to create features "to date".

Most of the code was a function (in R) similar to this

```points_tracking <- function (matches) {
 matches %>%
    arrange(fighter_a, id) %>%
    group_by(fighter_a, year) %>%
    mutate(win = if_else(w_l == "w" & method_cat == "points", 1, 0),
           lose = if_else(w_l == "l" & method_cat == "points", 1, 0),
           points_win_TD = cumsum(win),
           points_lose_TD = cumsum(lose),
           cum_win_points = lag(points_win_TD, default = 0),
           cum_lose_points = lag(points_lose_TD, default = 0)) %>%
    select(-win, -lose, -ends_with("TD")) %>%
    ungroup()
}```

## AUC Score of ~0.87 on validation data.
