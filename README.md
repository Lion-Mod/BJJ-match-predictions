##Why this was done (more detail in the notebook)

I wanted to work on a problem that could grow my data skills and on somrthing that (to my knowledge) has little or no one focusing on it. 

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a grappling sport that is still developing on the mat but not in the data world so I developed a baseline model for predicting matches. 

###Who this benefits


##AUC Score of ~0.87 on the validation data.
