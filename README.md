## Why this was done (more detail in the notebook)

I wanted to work on a problem that could grow my data skills and on somrthing that (to my knowledge) has little or no one focusing on it. 

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu ðŸ¥‹ is a grappling sport that is still developing on the mat but not in the data world so I developed a baseline model for predicting matches. 

### Who this benefits
* **Match makers** - pair competitors with similar performances or certain styles
* **Coaches** - use data to analyse who their athlete's next competitor is and their style both currently and historically to improve training approaches for competition
* **Analysts/commentators** - stats about a fighter can be useful but when you have to watch hours of footage to get them, not efficient. These simple features can help find stats about a fighter to date or historically. Also some stats that aren't necessarily obvious or easy to compute using a brain could be encorporated into live commentatary. 

## AUC Score of ~0.87 on the validation data.
